# Student_Management_System
A simple Java-based student management system project
The Student Management System is a simple Java-based console application developed by Siddhivinayak Narale for managing student records, book information, and exam details using core Java concepts like classes, objects, and arrays. It features a basic command-line interface that allows administrators or librarians to add, view, and manage student and exam data in a structured manner. Designed primarily for learning and educational purposes, this project showcases object-oriented programming practices without relying on external libraries or databases. The code is organized into multiple classes such as Student, Book, Exam, Administrator, and Librarian, making it modular and easy to understand. Users can run the project in any Java IDE or compile and execute it via the terminal. Future improvements may include database integration, user authentication, file storage, or GUI support. This project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/siddhivinayakN/Student_Management_System and is open-source for anyone looking to explore or contribute.
